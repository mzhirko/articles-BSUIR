# Scientific activity in BSUIR

This reposotory is dedicated to all scientific projects and investigations that were done by me in Belarusian University of Informatics and Electronics. Part of them were not officially published, though i firmly believe that they may serve as an example for future investigations on the presented topics.

The corresponding english translation is provided in README files.
